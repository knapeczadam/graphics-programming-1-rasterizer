# 🛺 Graphics Programming 1 – Rasterizer  

Hey there, fellow DAE student, curious visitor, or graphics enthusiast 👋  
Welcome to my **Graphics Programming 1 – Rasterizer** repository — part of the **third semester (2023)** at **DAE**.

---

## 🗄️ About this repository

This repo contains all **lab exercises** and **weekly projects** created during the **Graphics Programming 1** course.  
It’s shared mainly for **archival and educational purposes** — documenting my learning progress in **low-level rendering** and **graphics programming**.

This was my **second major graphics project** at DAE — following the **Raytracer** from *GP1*, and paving the way for the **DirectX-based renderer**. 

> ⚠️ Keep in mind: these projects were made while learning the fundamentals of computer graphics.  
> Expect jagged edges, aliasing, and a fair amount of math-induced confusion — it’s all part of the process.  
> Consider this repo a **snapshot of early rendering experiments**.

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

This repository represents my first steps into **real-time rendering concepts** — building a **fully CPU-based rasterizer** from the ground up.  
From transforming vertices and performing clipping, to interpolating pixels and lighting them manually — every step exposed what GPUs normally handle behind the scenes.  
It was an eye-opening experience that bridged the gap between **raytracing** and **hardware-accelerated graphics**.

If you’re exploring rasterization yourself: **visualize every stage of the pipeline**, and remember — every pixel on screen is the result of your math running in real time ⚙️🖼️
